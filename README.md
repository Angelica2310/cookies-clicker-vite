## Reflection
### What requirements did you achieve?
All
### What was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
After only one week of learning React and a bit struggle from the beginning, I’m quite satisfied with the results so far of the way I have used useState, useEffect, components, setInterval, .map() effectively.
### Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
There is one thing that I wish I could get to work. When the users buy an upgrade, it logs the quantity, however the quantity is not saved in local storage. I wrote the code but for some reason, the code doesn't work.
