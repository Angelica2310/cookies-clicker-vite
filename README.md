ðŸŽ¯ What requirements did you achieve?
I have used useState, useEffect, components, setInterval, .map() effectively. The game also has logic so the user can play and buy upgrade items, which is fetched from an API. The game also has sound effects and and UI styles to provide a pleasant while playing the game. Game also be saved to local storage so user can leave and come back to continue playing. Others function such as instruction of how to play the game and ugrade buttons are disabled when user doesn't have enough cookies to buy are added to make the game more fun.
ðŸŽ¯ Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
No.
ðŸŽ¯ If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
There is one thing that I wish I could work. When user buy an upgrade, it logs the quantity, however the quantity will not be saved in local storage. I wrote the code but for some reasons the code doesn't work.
